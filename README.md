# Tensorflow Implementation of Deep SVDD
This repository provides a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) implementation of the *Deep SVDD* method presented in
ICML 2018 paper ”Deep One-Class Classification”.

The author's implementation of *Deep-SVDD* in PyTorch is at [https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch](https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch).
